# Le compte est bon

This game is inspired by the French TV show "[Des chiffres et des
lettres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_chiffres_et_des_lettres)".
Given a target number, and 6 starting numbers, the goal is to combine these
starting numbers using the four basic "+", "-", "*" and "/" operations to reach the target.

Two game modes:
- either choose to always have at least one solution: the game will generate a target by applying random operations to the starting numbers
- or choose to have a random target: the game will then check if it is reachable, and if not, compute the closest solution
