# Le compte est bon

This game is inspired by the French TV show "[Des chiffres et des
lettres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_chiffres_et_des_lettres)".
Given a target number, and 6 starting numbers, the goal is to combine these
starting numbers using the four basic "+", "-", "*" and "/" operations to reach the target.

In my implementation, there is always at least one solution, but the
proposed solution is rarely the simplest one!
